Starting a new clock project using using a different digital display sort of a epaper but lcd like display with better refresh rates
Also thinking BLE was nice but perhaps we can auto configure without it exposing an HTTP service might be better
On second thought I think BLE will be easier for configuration since it won't require the enduser's device to connect to a different network.
This does mean we'll have the challenge of not quiet enough memory to potentially power the display...
but we'll see if we need a second micro-controller then so be it...
